Casper Scripts
bill@talkingmoose.net


Purpose

These are a random set of scripts I've made for customers to work with JAMF Software's Casper Suite. They are some examples for accessing a JAMF Software Server (JSS) to download, upload or modify data as well as other functions.


Support

JAMF Software does not support these scripts. Please do not contact them for assistance. Contact JAMF Software if you need a custom script tailored to your environment.

For basic JSS API documentation, use a web browser to access the API page on your JSS at:
